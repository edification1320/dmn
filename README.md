# dmn
In this project we are creating some DMNs
- <b>DMNExample1</b>
  - Takes two input parameters, Age and CreditRatin, and gives a decision as 'Approved' or 'Rejected', describing either to reject or approve the loan application based on the values provided for 'Age' and 'CreditRating' input parameters.
- <b>DMNExample2</b> 
  - This also does the same decisioning as DMNExample1. But in this example, we explore how to use <b>'Custom objects'</b> in DMN's.
- <b>DMNExample3</b>
  - This also does the same decisioning as DMNExample1. But in this example, we explore how to use <b>'Hit Policy'</b> as <b>'PRIORITY'</b>.
- <b>DMNExample4</b>
  - This also does the same decisioning as DMNExample1. But in this example, we explore how to use a <b>'FEEL function'</b>, and how to define a decision using <b>'Literal Expression'</b>.
